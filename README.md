# Dot Matrix Chart
Attempting to create a dot matrix chart component.
Using RaphaelJS for SVG support in Javascript.

Was inspired to do this based on whats seen on 
https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Deadly-Animal-Mosquito-Week-2016?WT.mc_id=20161011133554_DeadliestAnimal_BG-TW&WT.tsrc=BGTW&linkId=29799796

And a brief serach online didnt churn out anything that could be used immediately.

Also using this as an opportunity to get familiar with Raphael and possibly jQuery as well.
